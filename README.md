How CPU works
-----------------
(32-bit (IA-32) - 64-bit (x86-64))

0. [Program Build Flow](Program-Build-Flow/Program_Build_Flow.md). 
1. x86 CPU Registers
2. Arithmetic Instructions (Intel syntax)
3. Moves, Jumps, syscalls, Branches
4. Little-Endian Format
*Most processors are little endian and most network protocols are big endian
5. Function prologue and epilogue
6. What is Stack How it works?!
