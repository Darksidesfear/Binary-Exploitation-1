CPU Functionality Content Made By Myself For Binary Exploitation

How CPU works
-----------------
(32-bit (IA-32) - 64-bit (x86-64))

0. [CPU-Registers](Registers/CPU-Registers.md)
1. [Arithmetic Instructions (Intel syntax)](Assembly/Arithmetic-Instructions.md)
2. [Little-Endian Format](Little-Endian/Little-Endian.md)
*Most processors are little endian and most network protocols are big endian
