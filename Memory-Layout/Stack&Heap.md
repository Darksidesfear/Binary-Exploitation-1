# Memory Layout of C program
1. Stack
2. Heap
3. BSS (Uninitialized data segment)
4. DS (Initialized data segment)
5. Text


+++STACK+++
-----------
The Stack is a fixed Size storage that stores local variables and function arguments (along with many other things) when the program execute.

**The stack contains a LIFO structure (pile of plates). Function variables are pushed onto the stack when called and functions variables are popped off the stack when return.

**Stack Grows From Highest address of memory to the lowest address of it.


EBP & ESP are the most important CPU registers for the stack


EBP -> points to the beginning of the *functions frame*.

ESP -> always tracks the top of the stack.

+++HEAP+++
----------
The Stack is a dynamic Size storage that used to allocate the memory at run time.

Heap area managed by the memory management functions like malloc, calloc, free, etc

**HEAP grows and shrinks in the opposite direction of the stack.


+++BSS -->(Uninitialized data segment)+++
----------------------------------
It contains all uninitialized global and static variables.

**All Variables = 0 & pointers =  null pointer

ex: int number1; static int number2;

+++DS -->(Initialized data segment)+++
----------------------------------
Unlike BSS, DS Contains the initialized global and static variables.

**The size of this segment is determined by the size of the values in the programâ€™s source code and does not change at run time.

+++TEST+++
----------
This Segment Contains a binary of the compiled program.

**The TEXT Segment is a read-only segment that prevents a program from being accidentally modified.
